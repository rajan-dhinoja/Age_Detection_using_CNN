# Age_Detection_using_CNN

Project Structure & Where to Save Code
📁 Age-Detection-Project (Root folder)
   📂 backend → Save Node.js API & Model files here
   📂 frontend → Save React frontend here
   📂 model → Save CNN model training files here
   📂 dataset → Save the training dataset here ( ! First, you have to make a sub-folder named 'dataset' in your project folder )

- Step-0: run pip install -r requirements.txt

- Step 1: Dataset Collection & Preprocessing
  1.1 Choose a Dataset
  1.2 Preprocess the Images
  Steps:
  ✅ Load images using OpenCV or PIL
  ✅ Resize images to (200x200)
  ✅ Normalize pixel values (0-1 range)
  ✅ Convert labels (ages) into numerical categories
  ✅ Split into train (80%) and test (20%) sets
  📂 Save in: model/preprocess.py

  - run cd model
  - run python preprocess.py

        After execution, you should see:
        ✅ Number of images processed
        ✅ A sample of 5 images displayed with age labels
        ✅ Preprocessed data saved as .npy files inside dataset/ folder:
        X_train.npy → Training images
        X_test.npy → Testing images
        y_train.npy → Training labels
        y_test.npy → Testing labels

- Step 2: Build and Train the CNN Model
  Now that we have preprocessed the dataset, we will:
  ✅ Define a CNN model architecture
  ✅ Load the preprocessed dataset (.npy files)
  ✅ Train the model on the dataset
  ✅ Save the trained model for later use
  📂 Save this script as: model/train_model.py

  - run cd model
  - run python train_model.py

        As the script runs, you will see:
        ✅ CNN model architecture summary
        ✅ Training progress (epochs, loss, and MAE values)
        ✅ Training and validation loss graphs
        ✅ Trained model saved as:
        📂 model/age_detection_model.h5

- Step 3: Backend - FastAPI for Model Inference
  We will:
  ✅ Use FastAPI to create the backend
  ✅ Load the trained CNN model (age_detection_model.h5)
  ✅ Accept an image upload from the frontend
  ✅ Preprocess the image and predict the age
  ✅ Return the predicted age as a JSON response
  📂 Save this backend inside: backend/ folder

  - run cd backend
  - run uvicorn main:app --reload

        You can test the API by uploading an image (Using Postman):
        1️⃣ Open Postman
        2️⃣ Set request type to POST
        3️⃣ Enter URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict
        4️⃣ In "Body" → Select "form-data" → Add a key:
        Key: file
        Type: File
        Upload an image
        5️⃣ Click Send

- Step 4: Frontend - React for Image Upload & Display Prediction
  We will:
  ✅ Create a React UI for image upload
  ✅ Send the image to the FastAPI backend
  ✅ Display the predicted age
  ✅ Use Tailwind CSS for a better UI
  📂 Save this inside: frontend/ folder

  - run cd frontend
  - run npm start

        ✅ Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000/
        ✅ You should see a file upload button
        ✅ Select an image and click Upload & Predict
        ✅ The predicted age will be displayed below! 🎉
